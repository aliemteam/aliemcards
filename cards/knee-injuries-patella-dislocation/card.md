# Knee Injuries: Patella Dislocation

![Patella dislocation drawing](image-1.png)

## X-ray Views

- AP knee
- Lateral knee: Best to assess for displacement
- Patella view: (sunrise or Merchant)

## Acute Management

- Closed reduction
- Splint in above-knee plaster cast (from distal 2/3s thigh to MTP foot joints), straight leg immobilizer, or hinged knee brace
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with crutches

## Follow-up Timing

Within 1-2 weeks

Consider sooner F/U to assess for associated osteochondral fractures and medial patellofemoral ligament injury, which may require operative repair 

## Notes

Most managed non-operatively

Complications: recurrent dislocations
