# Blunt Cerebrovascular Injuries (BCVI)

**Classic mechanisms of injury**

- **Carotid artery injury (CAI)**: Hyperextension of neck resulting in stretching of carotid artery over lateral processes of C1-C3.
- **Vertebral artery injury (VAI)**: Fracture through transverse process of C-spine, or hyperextension-stretch injury.

**Treatment**

- Antithrombotic agent (<span class="drug">heparin</span> vs <span class="drug">aspirin</span>)

## Denver Screening Criteria for BCVI 

**Signs / symptoms of BCVI**

- Arterial hemorrhage from neck, nose, or mouth
- Cervical bruit in patients &lt;50 years old
- Expanding cervical hematoma
- Focal neurologic deficit (TIA, hemiparesis, vertebrobasilar symptoms, Horner’s) 
- Neurologic exam incongruous with head CT findings
- CVA on CT or MRI 

**Risk factors for BCVI**

- LeFort II or III facial fracture
- C-spine fracture patterns: subluxation, fx extending into transverse foramen, fx involving C1-C3
- Basilar skull fracture with carotid canal involvement
- Petrous bone fracture
- Diffuse axonal injury with GCS &lt;6
- Near-hanging with anoxic brain injury
- Clothesline type injury or seat belt abrasion with significant swelling, pain, or altered mental status

## Imaging Choice

- **Gold standard**: Digital subtraction angiography
- **Accepted first-line imaging**: CT angiography (at least 16-slice scanner)
- **Alternative**: MRI (does not need contrast), may be less sensitive and less specific than CT
- NOTE: A simple seat-belt sign along the neck does not warrant a CT angiogram. Patients with higher risk findings such as significant pain, tenderness, swelling, and/or a bruit may need imaging.

## BCVI Grading and Incidence of CVA complication

| Grade | Definition                                                                                                                | CVA Rate Carotid | CVA Rate Vertebral |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| **1** | Irregularity of vessel wall, or dissection/intramural hematoma with &lt;25%luminal stenosis                               | 3%               | 6%                 |
| **2** | Intraluminal thrombus or raised intimal flap is visualized, or dissection/intramural hematoma with ≥25% luminal narrowing | 14%              | 38%                |
| **3** | Pseudoaneurysm                                                                                                            | 26%              | 27%                |
| **4** | Vessel occlusion                                                                                                          | 50%              | 28%                |
| **5** | Vessel transection                                                                                                        | 100%             | 100%               |

Risk of undiagnosed BVCI: Delayed CVA

- May occur hours to 14 years later) 
- Majority develop CVA symptoms in 10-72 hours
