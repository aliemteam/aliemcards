# Hip Injuries: Hip Dislocation

![](image-1.png)

## Xray Views

- AP pelvis
- CT to look for acetabular fracture, loose bodies, or femoral head fracture

## Acute Management

**Reduction immediately within 6 hours** (because of avascular necrosis risk)

## Follow-up Timing

Admit, and consult orthopedic surgeon

## Notes

**Posterior dislocation (90%):** Typically presents with hip flexed and adducted; 5-15% of posterior hip dislocations are associated with a femoral head fracture

**Anterior dislocation:** Typically presents with hip abducted and externally rotated
