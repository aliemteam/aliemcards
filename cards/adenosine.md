# Adenosine: 6-12-12 adenosine approach

The ACLS-recommended dosing strategy of 6 mg, 12 mg, and 12 mg for <span class="drug">adenosine</span> may not be appropriate in every situation. There are a few instances when lower or higher dosing should be considered.

*Caveat: *All recommendations are data-based, but many factors affect successful conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) including proper line placement and administration technique.

**Option 1: Starting at higher dose**

Caffeine is an <span class="drug">adenosine</span>blocker and can interfere with the successful reversion of PSVT. In fact, ingestion of caffeine less than 4 hours before a 6-mg <span class="drug">adenosine</span> bolus significantly reduced its effectiveness in the treatment of PSVT. An increased initial <span class="drug">adenosine</span>dose may be indicated for these patients.

Remember that theophylline may require higher dosing as well, because it is similar to caffeine (another methylxanthine), but is not prescribed much in the U.S. anymore.

***Recommended dosing strategy*** \[[Cabalag, 2009](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003123)\]:

-   1st dose: 12 mg (instead of 6)
-   2nd/3rd doses: 18 mg (instead of 12)

**Option 2: Starting at lower dose**

Every so often a patient arrives in PSVT with their only IV access being through a hemodialysis port. The initial <span class="drug">adenosine</span>dose should be reduced if administered through a central line. Remember a central line delivers the <span class="drug">adenosine</span>right where you need it. This recommendation is supported by the 2010 ACLS guidelines. Cases of prolonged bradycardia and severe side effects have been reported after full-dose <span class="drug">adenosine</span>through a central line.
Also consider lower doses in patients concomitantly taking carbamazepine or dipyridamole or in those with a transplanted heart.

-   1st dose: 3 mg (instead of 6)
-   2nd/3rd doses: 6 mg (instead of 12)
