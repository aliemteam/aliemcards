# Blunt Cardiac Injury

_Definition:_ Encompasses wide spectrum of clinical injuries, ranging from asymptomatic myocardial bruise to cardiac rupture/death 

No gold standard 

**Pearls:**

- Causes 20% of all deaths due to motor vehicle collisions
- Most commonly injured chamber: Right ventricle (most anterior in chest) 

**Clinical tips:**

- Suspect in anyone with significant blunt, deceleration, or crush trauma to chest
- Consider BCI in hemodynamically unstable patients without alternative cause
- Troponin I and T lack adequate sensitivity as screening test
