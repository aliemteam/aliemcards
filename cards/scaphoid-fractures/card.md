# Scaphoid Fracture - Adult

- **Most common** carpal fracture (70%), followed by triquetral and trapezium
- **Initial x-ray** (full scaphoid series): **Specificity is 100%** but **Sensitivity is 80%**
- **Pre-test probability** of scaphoid fracture in patient with scaphoid wrist pain and non-diagnostic x-rays is about **25%** (17-38% across 4 studies in this meta-analysis)

- **_Clamp Sign:_** Ask the patient “Exactly where does it hurt?” The patient will form a clamp with opposite thumb and index finger on both sides of the thumb
- **_Pain with resisted supination:_** Hold the hand of the injured extremity with the patient’s forearm in neutral position. Patient attempts to supination, resulting in pain when the examiner resists.

**NOTE:** There is limited usefulness for LR’s with wide CIs.

## Management Plan Based on X-Ray Findings

- Displaced (>1 mm) or proximal pole frature: Orthopedic/Hand consult in ED
- Non- or minimally displaced fracture: Splint and Ortho/Hand clinic follow up in 5-7 days
- Suspected fracture but non-diagnostics x-rays: Splint and follow up with primary care physician or Ortho/Hand clinic up for repeat exam and potentially repeat x-rays in 10-14 days

## Pearls

- The clinical exam has **high sensitivity** but **low specificity**
- **MRI is most sensitive and specific** imaging modality, but cost-benefit must be balanced with patient’s economic loss from being splinted or a missed fracture.
- Avascular necrosis and nonunion can occur leading to carpal instability and osteoarthritis 
  –   Those at greatest risk: Displaced scaphoid fractures and initially missed fractures
