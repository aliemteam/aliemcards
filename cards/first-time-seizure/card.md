# Seizure, New Onset

**Diagnostic Tests**

Glucose and electrolytes (most common abnormalities found are hypoglycemia and hyponatremia)

Urine pregnancy test, if appropriate

Consider urine toxicology screen

Head CT (noncontrast)

- For first-time seizures in setting of EtOH or EtOH-withdrawal, **6.2%** had clinical significant lesion ([Earnest et al., Neurology, 1988](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3419599))

Lumbar Puncture: Consider if new seizure PLUS -- fever, severe HA, immunocompromised, or persistent altered mental status 

## Suggested Workup

 Based on 1994 ACEP Clinical Policy 

## Decision to Start Anti-Epileptic Medication

- 65% risk of recurrent seizure in 1 year if:

1. Structural lesion on head CT, or 
2. Focal seizure which generalizes

No medication for uncomplicated 1st time seizure, defined as: 

- Age &lt; 40 years
- Nocomorbidities
- No neurologic deficits
- Back to baseline mental status
- Normalhead CT
- Normal labs 

Poor literature on short-term seizure recurrence
Coordinate with primary care physician
