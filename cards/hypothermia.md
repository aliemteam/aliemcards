# Hypothermia, Accidental

## Stages of Hypothermia:

**MILD HYPOTHERMIA** 32.2-35°C (90-95°F) 

| Early Stage      | Decompensated Stage                                |
| :-------------   | :-------------                                     |
| Hypertenstion    | Apathy/Impaired Judgment                           |
| Tachycardia      | Ataxia                                             |
| Shivering        | Cold diuresis-kidneys unable to concentrate urine  |
| Vasoconstriction | Hypovolemia                                        |


**MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA** 28-32.2°C (82.4-90°F)
|                           |                         |
|---------------------------|------------------------ |
| Atrial dysrhythmias       | Diminished gag reflex   |
| Hypotension, bradycardia  | LOSS of shivering       |
| Lethargy                  | Hyporeflexia            |
| Mydriasis                 | J wave on EKG!          |

**SEVERE HYPOTHERMIA** &lt;28°C (&lt;82.4°F)

|                     |                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Apnea               | Oliguria                  |       
| Coma                | Pulmonary edema           |
| No activity on EEG  | Ventricular dysrhythmias  |
| Fixed pupils        | Asystole                  |

**Tip:**

-   Many thermometers do not measure below 34.4°C (94°F). Need special low-tempsensing rectal or bladder thermometers.
-   Avoid jostling the hypothermic patient too much because of myocardial irritability and consequent arrhythmias.

## Direct complications from hypothermia and rewarming

-   Rhabdomyolysis
-   Acute tubular necrosis and renal failure
-   Electrolyte shifts, especially K+ because of acid-base changes during rewarming
-   Hypoglycemia from depleted glycogen stores
-   Functional coagulapathy: May have normal coag studies because have to be rewarmed to run the assay

## Rewarming approaches

1.  **Passive Rewarming:** Remove cold, damp clothes. Wrap with blankets.
2.  **Active External Rewarming:** applying heat to skin
    -   Heating blanket or radiant heat
    -   Hot water bottles or heating pads to truncal surfaces. Caution-- do not burn skin.
    -   Risk of “Core Temperature Afterdrop”, vasodilation with active external rewarming causes cold peripheral blood to return to heart. Give warm IV fluid beforehand.
    -   Risk of “Rewarming Acidosis”. Lactate from periphery returns to core circulation. May cause transient shock during rewarming.

3.  **Active Core Rewarming**

    -   Humidified air, 40°C (104°F) – increases core temp by 1-2.5°C (1.8-4.5°F) per hr
    -   Warm IV fluids at 40-45°C
    -   Cardiopulmonary bypass or hemodialysis, Increases core temp by 1-2°C (1.8-3.6°F) every 3-5 minutes
    -   Warm fluid lavage of stomach, colon, bladder, pleural space
    -   Peritoneal dialysis. Normal saline at 40-45°C at 6-10 L/hr increases core temp by 1-3°C (1.8-5.4°F) per hour when combined with heated oxygen.
    -   Mediastinal lavage via open thoracotomy

## Choosing a rewarming approach

**General approach:**

-   Check glucose.    
-   Consider thiamine 100 mg IV, esp if chronic EtOH at risk for Wernicke’s    
-   Treat underlying etiology for hypothermia 
-   Give antibiotics +/- steroids, as appropriate   

**If patient in cardiopulmonary arrest:**

-   Intubate, CPR, ACLS protocol
-   Warm IVF
-   Heated humidified oxygen
-   Extracorporeal rewarming (i.e. cardiopulmonary bypass), if not immediately available, do active core rewarming measures
-   Rewarm to target temperature &gt;30°C (86°F)


**If NOT in cardiopulmonary arrest AND temperature &lt;32°C (89.6°F):**

-   Active External Rewarming (i.e. Bair Hugger, warm blankets), and
-   Minimally invasive Active Core Rewarming (warm IVF, warm air)


**If NOT in cardiopulmonary arrest AND temp ≥32°C (89.6°F):**

-   Passive external rewarming measures
