# Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale

This variation of the adult Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is for children age <2 years old

- Total = 15 points 
- GCS score most useful when stated as individual sub-scores and total:  E4/V5/M6 = 15
- Should be applied in the assessment of children ≤2 years old in the PECARN Pediatric Head Injury decision tool [1](#ref_one)
