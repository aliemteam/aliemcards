# Cervical Spine Assessment: What are "distracting injuries"?

## The **NEXUS definition of "distracting injury"** is vague  

([Hoffman et al., NEJM, 2000)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10891516)

Defined as “a condition thought by the clinician to be producing pain sufficient to distract the patients from a second (neck) injury. Examples may include, but are not limited to the following:

- A long bone fracture
- A visceral injury requiring surgical consultation
- A large laceration, degloving injury, or crush injury
- Large burns
- Any other injury producing acute functional impairment

Physicians may also classify any injury as distracting if it is thought to have the potential to impair the patient’s ability to appreciate other injuries"

Distracting injury alone accounted for 30% of all radiographic studies ordered for the 818 NEXUS patients

## Injuries to the upper torso may be considered distracting injuries 

([Heffernan et al., J Trauma, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16394912))

**Study design:**

- Prospective study of blunt trauma patients
- Exclusion criteria: patient age &lt;18 years, prolonged ICU care, non-English speaking 

**Results:** (n=40 patients with cervical spine injury out of 406 patients)

-  7 of 40 patients (18%) had no neck pain or tenderness
-  All 7 patients had upper torso injuries.

## Severe pain or injuries in the chest may be considered distracting injuries

([Konstantinidis et al, J Trauma, 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21248650)) 

**Study design:**

- Prospective study of blunt trauma patients
- Exclusion criteria: GCS &lt;13, intoxication, patient age ≤16 years

**Results:**  (n =101 patients with a cervical spine injury out of 9,103 blunt trauma patients)

- 4 of 101 (4%) patients had no neck pain or tenderness
- All 4 patients had rib fractures or severe chest tenderness.
