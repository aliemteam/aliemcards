# Fractures, C1 and C2 Spine

## Atlanto-occipital dislocation

| Mechanism | Stable |
| --------- | ------ |
| Flexion   | No     |

-   Often instantly fatal
-   More common in children because small horizontally-oriented occipital condyles
-   Dislocation can be anterior (most common), superiorly distracted, or posterior

## Anterior atlantoaxial dislocation

| Mechanism | Stable |
| --------- | ------ |
| Flexion   | No     |

-   Associated with transverse ligament rupture
-   Most commonly occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis from ligament laxity
-   Widening of predental space seen on lateral plain film

## Jefferson fracture = C1 burst fracture

| Mechanism         | Stable |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| Axial Compression | No     |

-   33% with associated C2 fracture
-   Low incidence of neurologic injury because of wide C1 spinal canal
-   Usually involves fractures of both the anterior and posterior C1 arches, often with 3 or 4 fracture fragments
-   Complication: transverse ligament rupture, especially if C1 lateral masses are ≥7 mm wider than expected (MRI recommended)
-   Complication: vertebral artery injury (CT angiography recommended)

## C1 posterior arch fracture

| Mechanism | Stable |
| --------- | ------ |
| Extension | Yes    |

-   An associated C2 fracture (occurs 50% of time) makes the posterior arch fracture unstable
-   On plain films, no displacement of lateral masses on the odontoid view and no prevertebral soft tissue swelling, unlike Jefferson burst fracture

## C2 dens fracture

| Mechanism | Stable |
| --------- | ------ |
| Flexion   | +/-    |

-   _Type I_ (stable): Avulsion of dens with intact transverse ligament
-   _Type II_ (unstable): Fracture at base of dens; 10% have an associated rupture of the transverse ligament-- MRI provides definitive diagnosis of ligament rupture
-   _Type III_ (stable): Fracture of dens extending into vertebral body

## Hangman's fracture = C2 spondylolisthesis

| Mechanism | Stable |
| --------- | ------ |
| Extension | No     |

-   Bilateral C2 pedicle fractures
-   At risk for disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL), C2 anterior subuxation, and C2-C3 disk rupture
-   Low risk for spinal cord injury because of C2 anterior subluxation, which widens spinal canal

## Extension teardrop fracture

| Mechanism | Stable |
| --------- | ------ |
| Extension | No     |

-   Small triangular avulsion of anteroinferior vertebral body, at insertion point of anterior longitudinal ligament
-   Occurs most frequently at C2 level, but can occur in lower cervical spine
-   Complication: Central cord syndrome due to ligamentum flavum buckling during hyperextension
-   Requires CT differentiation from very unstable flexion teardrop fracture
