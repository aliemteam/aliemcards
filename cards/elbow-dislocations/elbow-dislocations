 # Elbow Injuries: Elbow Dislocation

![Image 1]

## XRAY views

- AP Elbow
- Lateral

## Acute Management

If Simple Posterior Dislocation
   - Closed reduction
   - Observe post reduction for delayed signs of vascular or compartment syndrome
   - Long arm posterior splint with elbow in 90 degree flexion

## Follow Up Timing

Admission
   - Vascular Injury
   - Open Dislocation
   - Unable to successfully close reduce the elbow

Urgent (<3 days)
   - Especially for complex dislocation, anterior dislocation or peripheral nerve injury

Less Urgent (< 7 days)
   - For simple posterior dislocations without neurovascular compromise
   - 1 week of immobilization with early range of motion exercises

## Notes

Classification:
   - Simple: No associated fracture
   - Complex: Associated with elbow fracture (1/3 of elbow dislocations)

Terrible Triad:
   - Elbow Dislocation
   - Coronoid process fracture
   - Radial head fracture

Complications:
   - Ulnar nerve neuropraxia (14%) [1]
   - Median nerve and brachial artery injuries (more common with anterior and open dislocations)
   - Compartment syndrome
