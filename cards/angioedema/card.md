# Angioedema

**Definition**: self-limited, asymmetric, localized, non-pitting swelling

**Background**

- 15% of population
- 50% with urticaria
- _Common sites:_ perioribtal, lips, tongue, extremity, bowel wall
- _Main cause of death:_ Laryngeal edema (25-40% mortality if present)

## Syndromes and Specific Treatments

**Idiopathic Angioedema**

- 38% of patients with angioedema

**Allergic or IgE Mediated Angioedema**

- Type I hypersensitivity reaction
- Commonly from food or medications
- _Tx:_ allergen avoidance, antihistamine, H2 blockers, glucocorticoid, epinephrine for laryngeal edema

**Hereditary Angioedema**

- C1q esterase inhibitor deficiency
- _Triggers:_ trauma (especially dental trauma), anxiety, menstruation, infection, exercise, alcohol consumption, stress
- _Prophylaxis tx:_ **danazol** better than tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid
- _Acute tx:_  **FFP**, C1 INH, icatibant, and ecallantide can all be used
- Usual IgE-mediated treatment regimen ineffective except epinephrine for laryngeal edema

**ACE Inhibitor Angioedema**

- 0.3-0.7% of those taking ACE-I's
- From elevated levels of bradykinin
- Highest incidence during 1st month of starting medication, but can occur years after 
- 5x more common in African-Americans compared to Caucasians
- Controversial whether patient can take ARBs (doesn’t cause elevated bradykinin) as well – some with angioedema.
- _Tx: _ discontinue medication and supportive care
- Usual IgE-mediated treatment regimen ineffective except epinephrine for laryngeal edema

**Treatment philosophy:** 

- Low threshold to protect airway by intubation
- If initial exam does not trigger an intubation frequent re-evaluations should be made as a patients clinical picture can change rapidly
- Once a decision for intubation has been made make sure you are prepared to perform an emergent cricothyroidotomy if necessary and consult Anesthesia or ENT. Also consider performing Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy to evaluate the patients airway and if needed as a primary airway technique. Finally consider NOT paralyzing these patients, and possibly using Ketamine as your induction agent
- _Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy_: consider performing on all patients with voice change to look for largnyeal edema
- **_Pearl:_** Be sure to prescribe patients Epi-pen if discharged home

## Admission guidelines for angioedema

([Ishoo et al., Head Neck Surg, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18374684))  

- 93 episodes in 80 patients (1985-95) with no deaths 
- 9.7% cases required intubation/tracheostomy
- _Causes:_ 39% from <span class="drug">ACE-I</span>
- _Disposition:_ 25% outpt, 23% floor, 53% ICU
- ICU admissions correlated with voice change, hoarseness, dyspnea, rash 
- Airway intervention correlated with voice change, hoarseness, dyspnea, stridor

**Proposed staging system:**

- **Stage I:** Facial rash, facial edema, lip edema - outpatient
- **Stage II**: Soft palate edema – outpatient or floor
- **Stage III:** Lingual edema --> ICU (7% required airway intervention)
- **Stage IV:** Laryngeal edema –> ICU (24% required airway intervention)
