Patients with higher risk findings such as significant pain, tenderness, swelling, and/or a bruit may need imaging.\n\n## BCVI Grading and Incidence of CVA complication\n\n| Grade | Definition  | CVA Rate Carotid   | CVA Rate Vertebral |\n|-------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| **1**     | Irregularity of vessel wall, or dissection/intramural hematoma with &lt; 25%luminal stenosis                               | 3%            | 6%             |\n| **2**     | Intraluminal thrombus or raised intimal flap is visualized, or dissection/intramural hematoma with ≥ 25% luminal narrowing | 14%           | 38%            |\n| **3**     | Pseudoaneurysm                                                                                                             | 26%           | 27%            |\n| **4**     | Vessel occlusion                                                                                                           | 50%           | 28%            |\n| **5**     | Vessel transection                                                                                                         | 100%          | 100%           |\n\nRisk of undiagnosed BVCI = delayed CVA (occurring hours to 14 years later) \n-   Majority develop CVA symptoms in 10-72 hours\n\n## References\n\n-   [Burlew CC, Biffl WL.
