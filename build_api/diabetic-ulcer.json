Probe-to-bone test\n2.  Ulcer area &gt; 2 cm2\n3.  ESR &gt; 70 mm/hr\n\n-   Best negative predictor is MRI foot (sensitivity 90%, specificity 83%)\n\n| **Finding**                          | **+LR\\*** | **-LR\\*** |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Erythema, swelling, purulence        | 1.5       | 0.84      |\n| Positive probe-to-bone test          | **6.4**   | 0.39      |\n| Ulcer area (LxW) &gt; 2 cm2          | **7.2**   | 0.48      |\n| Clinical gestalt+/- Wagner grade     | 5.5       | 0.54      |\n| ESR &gt; 70 mm/h                     | **11**    | 0.34      |\n| Plain film evidence of osteomyelitis | 2.3       | 0.63      |\n| MRI foot                             | 3.8       | **0.14**  |\n\n**Note:**\n-   Serum WBC and soft tissue swab culture = not diagnostic\n-   Soft tissue culture: Identified same pathogens as bone culture only 19-36% isolates.
